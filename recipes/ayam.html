  <h2 class= "seven">Description</h2>
  <p class= "saeran">Ayam buah keluak is a very traditional chicken curry that owes its origin to the Nyonya community in Malacca. However, something that not many people know, is that the Portuguese Eurasians in this city have also long been cooking this highly aromatic dish.</p>
  <h3 class= "seven">Ingredients</h3>
  <ul class= "saeran">
    <li>chicken</li>
    <li>buah keluak</li>
    <li>prawns and chicken meat</li>
    <li>cornflour</li>
    <li>Onions (Bawang Besar)</li>
    <li>Red Chillies (Chilli Merah)</li>
    <li>Galangal (Lengkuas)</li>
    <li>Lemongrass (Serai)</li>
    <li>Turmeric (Kunyit)</li>
    <li>Shrimp Paste (Belacan)</li>
    <li>Candlenuts (Buah Keras, Kukui Nuts)</li>
    <li>Tamarind (Asam Jawa)</li>
    <li>Kaffir Lime Leaves (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class= "seven">Steps</h3>
  <ol class= "saeran">
    <li><h4>Soak and Scrub Buah Keluak</h4>
        <ol><li>Soak the buah keluak for 5 days, changing the water every day.</li>
        <li>On the 4th day, scrub the buah keluak, then top with fresh water and soak for the last day. This is optional, but I like to do it to ensure none of the ash hangs about.</li>
        <li>After 5 days, scrub the buah keluak again with a stiff vegetable brush. It takes me about 30 to 45 seconds per seed.</li></ol></li>        
    <li><h4>Lightly Marinate the Chicken</h4>
    <p>All we do is rub some turmeric powder with a pinch of salt and leave while we get on with everything else.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Make the Spice Paste (Rempah)</h4>
    <p>This is a simple case of grinding everything down in a chopper, or with pestle and mortar, if that is your thing.</p>

    <p>Reserve the chopper for the next step, with 1 Tbsp of the paste.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Buah Keluak Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Tap and break the lip of each buah keluak with a pestle. Some people use a pair of scissors or cutting pliers (side cutters). But I prefer cracking the lip with a pestle.
            Using the back of a small fork or teaspoon, dig out the buah keluak meat and drop it into a bowl. Or if you have a lobster pick or fork, use that. Or what works perfectly also? Knitting needle!</p>
        <p>This takes me about 1 minute per seed. So 15 seeds, about 15 to 20 minutes? Reserve the shells.</p></li>
        <li>In the same chopper you used earlier (or the mortar), mince the prawns (shrimp), chicken and buah keluak meat to get a smooth paste, along with a pinch of salt, some sugar (to counter the bitterness), lime juice and cornflour for binding.</li>
        <li>Now, remember the empty shells? Using the back of a small spoon or fork, stuff the prepared filling back in the shell to the brim. Smooth out the top and set aside. This will take you 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li><h4>Cooking</h4>
    <ol class= "saeran">
        <li>Saut√© the paste.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and coat, then add tamarind.</li>
        <li>Add water, stuffed buah keluak and everything else and bring to a simmer. Cook for 45-60 minutes until the chicken is done. This will depend on the size of your portions.</li>
        <li>At the end of cooking time, check seasoning and adjust. We are going for a rich, creamy and slightly tangy flavour with a fragrant gravy.</li>
    </ol></li>
